Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In this project, I learned about how sequence data types work in Python - specifically, lists and tuples.
nal list is a multiple of 2.
        Without importing modules.

	    11. Delete at
	            11-delete_at.py: Python function that deletes an item at a specific position in a list.
		            If idx is negative or out of range (greater than the number of elements in my_list), the function returns the original list.
			            Without imporitng modules or using pop().

				        12. Switch
					        12-switch.py: Python program that switches the values of variable a and b.
						        Completion of this source code.

							    13. Linked list palindrome
							            13-is_palindrome.c: C function that checks if a singly-linked list is a palindrome.
								            If the function is not a palindrome - returns 0.
									            If the function is a palindrome - returns 1.
										            An empty list is considered a palindrome.
											            Helper files:
												                linked_lists.c: C functions handling linked lists for testing 13-is_palindrome.c (provided by Holberton School).
														            lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 13-insert_number.c.

															        14. CPython #0: Python lists
																        100-print_python_list_info.c: C function that prints basic information about Python lists.
